<li>"Chapter 5 is... an astonishing tour de force", <br>
<i>Steven G. Krantz, The American Mathematical Monthly.</i></li>
<li>"For a treatment [of infinite products and the Bernoulli series] that is very close to Euler's and even more elementary..." <br>
<i>V. S. Varadarajan, Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society.</i></li>
<li> "This is a very intriguing, decidedly unusual, and very satisfying treatment of calculus and introductory analysis. It's full of quirky little approaches to standard topics that make one wonder over and over again, 'Why is it never done like this?'" <br>
